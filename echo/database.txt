Example commands:

mysql -u schreck -p -h thunder.ucar.edu -D optuna -e 'show tables'
mysql -u schreck -p -h thunder.ucar.edu -D optuna -e 'select * from studies'

study = optuna.create_study(
    study_name="example", storage="mysql://schreck:l3tm31n@thunder.ucar.edu/optuna"
)

optuna.delete_study(
    study_name="example", storage="mysql://schreck:l3tm31n@thunder.ucar.edu/optuna"
)
